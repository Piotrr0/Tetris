# Tetris

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic *Tetris* game built using the Raylib game development library. The game faithfully replicates the familiar mechanics and gameplay of *Tetris*, where players must rotate and place falling blocks (tetrominoes) to form complete lines. The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the screen.
